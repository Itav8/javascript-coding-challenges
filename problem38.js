// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

const maxProfit = prices => {
  // Your solution
};

console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // 5
console.log(maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])); // 0
